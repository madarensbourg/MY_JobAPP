## Approach Taken towards MVP and Completion
Since i am graduating from General assembly i figured i could make the job appilication process easier. I was eager to create an application that would allow a user to generate new resumes and coverletters and store them in the app. Originally I was still thinking of using either a MERN or FERN stack, but with the requirement of storing my resumes as file data but firebase proved to be problematic. This led me to use a MERN  stack for my application. Learning the OpenChat GPT was pretty complicated for me however i was able to figure out how to get it to work. I was still able to complete an application that met my MVP goals which i feel really accomplished about however i would like to focus on styling. i set up the groundwork of the application so that i can work on it later. 
## Unsolved Problems and Hurdles
Learning how to navigate the 3rd party API was a new stack, FRN, was an endevor that I knew was going to be difficult, but I also knew that with so many resources to guide me it would be an accomplishable task. Picking the right resources turned out to be crucial for completing this application. Some tutorials or how to's can be misleading or not conducive in practice and this led me to trying a myriad of ways to accomplish one thing. Such as authorization, Firebase is definitely an appreciated crutch when it comes to authorization, but how you choose to incorporate the feature into the application can vary and really depends and how you want you're final product to interact with the user, for example, whether you wish to use private routes or not.
